# SQL DSL Implementation in Racket

## Overview

This project implements a domain-specific language (DSL) for querying and manipulating data using two different approaches:
1. `core-lists.rkt` - Uses a list-based implementation for the query results.
2. `core-streams.rkt` - Uses a stream-based implementation for the query results to optimize performance in certain cases.

### Features

#### Core Features
1. **from**
   - Creates a `QueryResult` from a table of data. Supports optional prefixing of column names.

2. **where**
   - Filters rows based on a predicate function.

3. **select**
   - Projects specified columns from the dataset. Raises an error if a requested column is absent.

4. **join**
   - Implements a nested-loop join of two datasets, checking for column conflicts and combining matching rows.

5. **join/hash**
   - Implements a hash join of two datasets for faster performance in certain scenarios. See the "Performance Analysis" section for details.

6. **limit**
   - Retains only the first `n` rows of the dataset.

7. **distinct**
   - Removes duplicate rows from the dataset.

8. **aggregate**
   - Groups rows by a specified column and applies an aggregator to compute results. Raises an error if required columns are missing.

9. **order-by**
   - Sorts rows by a specified column using a comparator function.

10. **extend**
    - Adds a new column by computing a value based on other columns.

#### Additional Features
- **Sorting with `order-by`**: Similar to SQL's `ORDER BY`.
- **Derived Columns with `extend`**: Allows creating computed columns dynamically.

## Avoiding Full Dataset Processing

### Operations That Can Avoid Full Dataset Processing
1. **limit**: Stops processing as soon as the required number of rows is retrieved.
2. **where**: Can short-circuit if used with `limit`, filtering rows lazily.
3. **join/hash**: The hash table is built lazily for the second dataset, avoiding complete processing of the first dataset in streams.

### Operations That Require Full Dataset Processing
1. **distinct**: Requires scanning the entire dataset to ensure uniqueness.
2. **aggregate**: Needs all rows to compute grouped results.
3. **order-by**: Requires sorting all rows, which inherently needs the full dataset.

### Explanation
Stream-based implementations are advantageous when partial results are sufficient, as they delay computation until needed. However, some operations (e.g., sorting and aggregation) inherently depend on the complete dataset.

## Performance Analysis: Join Implementations

### Nested Loop Join (`join`)
- Iterates over both datasets in a nested manner.
- Time complexity: **O(m Ã— n)** (where `m` and `n` are the sizes of the two datasets).
- Both `core-lists` and `core-streams` show significant time for large datasets.

### Hash Join (`join/hash`)
- Builds a hash table for one dataset, then probes it for matches from the other dataset.
- Time complexity: **O(m + n)** (hash table build + lookup).
- Significantly faster than nested loop join.

### Observations
- `join/hash` in `core-streams`: Faster due to lazy evaluation of streams, reducing memory overhead.
- `join/hash` in `core-lists`: Processes the entire dataset but still faster than the nested-loop join.

### Why Hash Join is Faster
- Hash table operations (insert and lookup) are **O(1)** on average, drastically reducing the time compared to the nested loop approach.
- Memory locality and reduced iterations make `join/hash` efficient even for large datasets.

## Test Case Results

### Query Example
```racket
(query/rows
  (from routes)
  (join/hash (from airlines #:qualify 'airline)
             'airline-id 'airline.airline-id)
  (where (lambda (row) (equal? (hash-ref row 'airline.name) "American Airlines")))
  (select 'source-airport 'destination-airport)
  (limit 3))
```

### Performance Comparison
| Implementation       | Time (ms) | GC Time (ms) |
|---------------------------|-----------|---------|
| `core-lists: join`        | 24,343    | 2,500   |
| `core-lists: join/hash`   | 219       |   109   |
| `core-streams: join`      | 19,611    | 2,765   |
| `core-streams: join/hash` | 225       |    78   |

### Explanation
- The hash join significantly reduces time as it avoids redundant comparisons by leveraging hash table lookups.
- Stream-based implementations are slightly faster for `join/hash` due to lazy evaluation, further minimizing memory usage.

## Conclusion
The use of streams and hash join improves the performance of the DSL for large datasets. Operations like `limit` and `where` benefit from streams, while `join/hash` drastically reduces computation time for joining operations.
